Objective:
  -The objective of this project is to create a simple web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
  -The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations conveniently within a web browser.

Overview:
 -This project consists of a single HTML file that contains the structure of the calculator, including input fields and buttons. 
 -CSS is used for styling to enhance the visual appearance of the calculator, making it intuitive and user-friendly. 
 -JavaScript functions handle user interactions, such as appending numbers to the display, clearing the display, and performing calculations.

Features:
 -Basic Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using the calculator.
 -Clear Display: The "C" button allows users to clear the display area, providing a convenient way to start a new calculation.
 -Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal display and functionality across various devices and screen sizes.
 -Intuitive Interface: Buttons are labeled with numeric digits and common mathematical symbols, making it easy for users to input and visualize calculations.
 -Error Handling: While basic error handling is implemented, such as clearing the display in case of invalid input, the calculator is not intended for complex mathematical expressions or extensive error detection. It provides a simple and straightforward way to perform common arithmetic calculations.
